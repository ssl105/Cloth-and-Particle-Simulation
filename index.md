# Background

Particle systems have varius uses in graphics since it mimics the elementary particles in the real world. Particles can be used to simulate fire, water, explosions, and other phenomena. When particles are combined with different forces, they can be used to simulate fabric animations.

# Physics

In order to animate particles, we can use Newtonian mechanics to apply forces on the particle.

Using variables we can define a particles position over time as a function $$r(t)$$ where $$t$$ is the time when a particle is in position $$r(t)$$.
